Sure! Here are four unit tests for the given function:

1. Test Case: num1 is positive and num2 is negative
   `absolute_square(5, -3)`
   Expected Output: 64

2. Test Case: num1 is zero and num2 is positive
   `absolute_square(0, 7)`
   Expected Output: 49

3. Test Case: num1 is negative and num2 is zero
   `absolute_square(-9, 0)`
   Expected Output: 81

4. Test Case: num1 and num2 are both positive
   `absolute_square(2, 4)`
   Expected Output: 4

These test cases cover different scenarios and edge cases to ensure the function works correctly.
